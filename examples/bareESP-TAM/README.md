# Further information on the usage of bareESP-TAM.ino

Yes, it was developed for a M5StickC. It was adopted to a bare ESP8266/ESP32module and needs only a button. The informative part is done over Serial.
The idea behind this was the challenge for elderly people to recognize easily the status of the Telephone-Answering-Machine (TAM). However the fritz!fon buttons are small and the menu too complex. Therefore some Gigasets E290HX were used, because the HD feature is pretty good for those people, the buttons are big and it has an loudness amplifier. But there is no TAM station like the E290A, this would be ideal. 
A useful extention to this sketch could be a muted telephone as a Do-not-disdurb button.
